Hosting react app

One can host their react app online for free using any of the below ways:

Netlify. Vercel. AWS Amplify. Firebase. GitHub Pages. GitLab Pages. Render. Surge.

There are several hosting build tools but I found vercel to be the simplest even for json server all at one place..

Hosting react app using vercel:

To deploy our react proj to vercel all you need is to upload our react proj to github and import the react proj to vercel via dashboard u can edit the app name and check the root directory path and thats it hit deploy button once deployment is successful u could preview our deployed app and the link of the deployed app there itself :) post deploying our github url in vercel on successful deployment the final deployed app link is below:

https://topjobs-sand.vercel.app/

for deploying local db.json to vercel refer :

https://github.com/kitloong/json-server-vercel

update db.json in above link and deploy the github repo cloned from above url and here are the deployed urls post successful deployment

This is like hosting our local json server file to cloud post development.
